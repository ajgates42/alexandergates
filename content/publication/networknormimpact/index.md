abstract: "The impact of a scientific publication is often measured by the number of citations it receives
from the scientific community. However, citation count is susceptible to well-documented
variations in citation practices across time and discipline, limiting our ability to compare
different scientific achievements. Previous efforts to account for citation variations often rely
on a priori discipline labels of papers, assuming that all papers in a discipline are identical in
their subject matter. Here we propose a network-based methodology to quantify the impact of
an article by comparing it with locally comparable research, thereby eliminating the discipline
label requirement. We show that the developed measure is not susceptible to discipline
bias and follows a universal distribution for all articles published in different years, offering
an unbiased indicator for impact across time and discipline. We then use the indicator to
identify science-wide high impact research in the past half century and quantify its temporal
production dynamics across disciplines, helping us identifying breakthroughs from diverse,
smaller disciplines, such as geosciences, radiology, and optics, as opposed to citation-rich
biomedical sciences. Our work provides insights into the evolution of science and paves a
way for fair comparisons of the impact of diverse contributions across many fields."
