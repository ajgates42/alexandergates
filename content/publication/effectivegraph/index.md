abstract: "The ability to map causal interactions underlying genetic control and cellular signaling has led to increasingly accurate models of the complex biochemical networks that regulate cellular function.  These network models provide deep insights into the organization, dynamics, and function of biochemical systems, e.g. by revealing genetic control pathways involved in disease.  However, the traditional representation of biochemical networks as binary interaction graphs fails to accurately represent an important dynamical feature of these multivariate systems: some pathways propagate control signals much more effectively than do others.  Such heterogeneity of dynamical interactions reflects *canalization*---the system is robust to interventions in redundant pathways, but responsive to interventions in effective pathways.

Here, we introduce the *effective graph*, a weighted graph that captures the nonlinear logical redundancy present in biochemical network regulation, signaling, and control.  Using 78 experimentally-validated models derived from systems biology, we demonstrate that: (a) redundant pathways are prevalent in biological models of biochemical regulation, (b) the effective graph provides a statistical but precise characterization of multivariate dynamics in a causal graph form, and (c) the effective graph provides an accurate explanation of how perturbation and control signals, such as those induced by cancer drug therapies, propagate in biochemical pathways. Overall, our results indicate that the effective graph provides an enriched description of the structure and dynamics of networked multivariate causal interactions. We demonstrate that it improves explainability, prediction, and control of complex dynamical systems in general, and biochemical regulation in particular. "

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'Many biological networks are modeled with multivariate discrete dynamical systems. Current theory suggests that the network of interactions captures salient features of system dynamics, but it misses a key aspect of these networks: some interactions are more important than others due to dynamical redundancy and nonlinearity. This unequivalence leads to a canalized dynamics that differs from constraints inferred from network structure alone. To capture the redundancy present in biochemical regulatory and signaling interactions, we present the effective graph, an experimentally validated mathematical framework that synthesizes both structure and dynamics in a weighted graph representation of discrete multivariate systems. Our results demonstrate the ubiquity of redundancy in biology and provide a tool to increase causal explainability and control of biochemical systems.'
