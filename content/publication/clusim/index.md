abstract: "Clustering similarity measures can be classified based on the cluster types: i) partitions that group elements into non-overlapping clusters, ii) hierarchical clusterings that group elements into a nested series of partitions (a.k.a. dendrogram), or iii) overlapping clusterings with elements belonging to multiple clusters.  Here, we introduce CluSim, a python package providing a unified library of over 20 clustering similarity measures for partitions, dendrograms, and overlapping clusterings."
