Many biological networks can be modeled with multivariate discrete dynamical systems.  Current modeling theory suggests that the network structure of interactions captures salient features of system dynamics, but it misses a key aspect of these networks: some interactions are more important than others due to dynamical redundancy and nonlinearity.  This unequivalence leads to a canalized dynamics that is different from dynamical constraints inferred from network structure alone.

To capture the redundancy present in biochemical regulatory and signaling interactions, we present the *effective graph*, an experimentally-validated mathematical framework that leads to a synthesis of both structure and dynamics in a new weighted graph representation of discrete multivariate systems. Our results demonstrate the ubiquity of redundancy in biology and provide a novel tool to increase causal explainability and control of biochemical regulation and signaling.
