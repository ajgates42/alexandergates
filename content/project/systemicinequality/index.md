Attempts to quantify the influence of systemic inequality on careers are hindered by a complex interplay between multiple factors: individual success is not just grounded in individual performance, but is largely impacted by institutional practices that can limit the access for some individuals to future opportunities, and offer a winners-take-all outcome for others.  These interlocking effects suggest that, to truly understand the impact of systemic bias on careers, it is not enough to focus on selected institutions or single metrics, but we need to map entire ecosystems to disentangle individual performance from the structural patterns that reinforce systematic bias.  Here, we explore systemic gender differences in science & art.
