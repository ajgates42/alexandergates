Autopoiesis is a proposed formal organizational property of living systems, defined as “a network of processes of production (synthesis and destruction) of components, such that these components: 1) continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes that produces them, and 2) constitute the system as a distinguishable unity in the domain in which they exist”.

In order to characterize the viability of autopoietic systems, we propose quantitative definitions for several of the core concepts in autopoiesis. *Viability* is defined as expected life span of an organization given an initial configuration.  *Robustness* is the tendency for a system to retain its configuration despite internal or external perturbations.  *Plasticity* refers to a systemʼs malleability in response to perturbation.  *Adaptivity* is associated with increases in an individualʼs viability resulting from interactions with its environment.

We introduce a spatial model of concentration dynamics that supports the emergence of spatiotemporal inhomogeneities that engage in metabolism–boundary co-construction: the hallmark of Autopoietic organizations.  A network of possible ontogenies is uncovered by subjecting a model protocell to sequential perturbations and mapping the resulting structural configurations. The combination of this model and analytical techniques provides a foundation for studying the emergence of viability, ontogeny, and adaptivity in more biologically realistic systems.
