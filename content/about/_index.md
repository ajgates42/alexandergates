Alex Gates is currently an Associate Research Scientist in the Center for Complex Network Research, Network Science Institute, Northeastern University working with Distinguished University Professor Albert-Laszlo Barabasi.  He has developed a multi-faceted research program exploring how connectivity shapes the careers of scientists, artists, and non-profit leaders & organizations

Alex's research philosophy is grounded systems theory in that he conceptualizes the innovation process as emerging from the non-trivial behavior and relationships of individuals---innovators are not equally exchangeable; rather, they have unique history-dependent skills and knowledge, they interact in teams, are embedded in complex networks of relationships, and they move between organizations stimulating the diffusion of ideas, policies, and practices within markets. My work explores the performance and success driving innovative careers, and the influence of strategic decisions made by the managers and administrators who support them.
